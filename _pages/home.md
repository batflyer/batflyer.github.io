    <p>I am a Health Informatics Ph.D. Student with the <a href="https://prohealth.sice.indiana.edu/">Proactive Health Informatics (ProHealth)</a> department within the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering (SICE) at Indiana University, Bloomington. Working with my advisor <a href="http://wphomes.soic.indiana.edu/connelly/">Professor Kay Connelly</a> and other members of the ProHealth group, I am involved in the <a href="https://grandchallenges.iu.edu/precision-health/index.html">Precision Health Initiative</a>. This grand challenge seeks to cure one form of cancer, cure at least one childhood disease, find a preventative solution to one chronic illness, or find a preventative solution to a neurodegenerative disease by 2020.</p>
    <p>I continue to work closely with the <a href="https://starling.utdallas.edu">StARLinG Lab</a> and the <a href="https://cs.utdallas.edu/cmachinelearning/">Center for Machine Learning</a> at the University of Texas at Dallas, collaborating with Professors <a href="http://utdallas.edu/~sxn177430/">Sriraam Natarajan</a> and <a href="https://gkunapuli.github.io">Gautam Kunapuli</a>.</p>

  <p>My interests are in Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence (STARAI), Systems, and Open Source Development&mdash;and their application to solving real-world problems within Health Informatics. I believe that open development, open data, and explainable decision-making systems are great starting points for building trust in artificial intelligence, and more broadly for systems that people can use in their everyday lives.</p>
