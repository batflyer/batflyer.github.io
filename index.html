      <p>Computer Science Ph.D. Student at The University of Texas at Dallas, advised by <a href="http://utdallas.edu/~sxn177430/">Professor Sriraam Natarajan</a>. My interests are in machine learning and its applications; as well as systems, open-source development, and theory of computation. I believe that open development and explainable decision-making systems are great starting points for building trust in artificial intelligence.</p>
